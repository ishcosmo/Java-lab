package ECommerce;
/*4)In an Online Shopping System, different methods for handling product inventory and discounts need to be securely managed.
 Create a package ECommerce containing a class Product with a public method getProductDetails() to retrieve product information, 
 a protected method applyDiscount() for internal discount management, 
 a default-access method updateStock() for inventory updates within the same package,
  and a private method calculateProfit() that computes earnings internally.
   Then, create another package CustomerPortal with a class CustomerCart that attempts to access these methods from an instance of Product. 
   Demonstrate which methods are accessible and explain how Javaâ€™s access control 
   mechanism ensures that only the appropriate users can access sensitive product operations.*/
